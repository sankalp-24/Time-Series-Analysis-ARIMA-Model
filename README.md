# Time-Series-Analysis-ARIMA-Model


ABSTRACT : One of the most important tasks for any retail store company is to analyze the performance of its stores. The main challenge faced by any retail store is predicting in advance the sales and inventory required at each store to avoid overstocking and under-stocking. This helps the business to provide the best customer experience and avoid getting into losses, thus ensuring the store is sustainable for operation.


PROBLEM STATEMENT : Read the superstore data and forecast about the sales of furniture for the next year.


APPROACH : To analyze and forecast future furniture sales using historical sales data.


Tools & Libraries: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Statsmodels


Key Steps:
	•	Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset, including date parsing and filtering for furniture-related sales.
	•	Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends, seasonality, and patterns in sales.
	•	Applied time series decomposition to separate trend, seasonality, and residual components.
	•	Built a forecasting model using techniques such as ARIMA/Exponential Smoothing (based on implementation).
	•	Evaluated forecast accuracy using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

 
Outcome: Generated reliable sales forecasts, enabling better inventory and business planning. Demonstrated the application of time series modeling to real-world retail data.
